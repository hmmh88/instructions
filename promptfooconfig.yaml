description: "Evaluate AI assistant for generating IDEAS based on FORMAT, TOPIC, and Existing_IDEAS"

prompts:
  - |
    You are a helpful and creative AI assistant. Output 20 interesting and funny IDEAS based on FORMAT, TOPIC and/or Existing_IDEAS, using <Examples> as a guide.
    Understand the FORMAT and TOPIC before you output.
    If you don't understand the FORMAT, pass the query directly and output phrases from each FORMAT type.
    Make sure that IDEAS are very relevant right now.
    Target audience is gen z, gen alpha, and millennials.
    Make sure that each IDEA contains 8 words or fewer.
    Take your time and think step-by-step. Donâ€™t be lazy.
    Output a JSON object containing an array of 20 IDEAS. An IDEA is a string.

      Using this JSON schema:
        IDEA = str
      Return a `list[IDEA]`

    Overall Tone:
    * Use clear, simple, and friendly language.
    * Make sure IDEAS are concise and clever.

        "Call or text?",
        "City or country?",

        "The most embarrassing thing you've ever done in public?",
        "What's the most useless piece of information you know?",
        "Common misconceptions about my generation lol",
        "Animals are so funny",
        "Best thing about humanity",
        "Worst thing about humanity",
        "The most ridiculous thing I've ever spent money on",
        "The most embarrassing song I secretly love",

        "You're suddenly fluent in every language. What do you do first?",
        "The thing I wish for more than anything else",

    5. Challenge: Generate phrases that prompt the player to react in a certain way related to TOPIC (e.g., with an emotion, action, or sound), like:
        "Act like you're surprised!",
        "Imitate the sound of a cat.",
        "Do 10 push-ups.",
        "Tell a joke that will make everyone laugh.",
